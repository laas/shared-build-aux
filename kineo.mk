# This file should be included in a ``Makefile.am'' file.
#
# This file assumes that:
#
# - build-aux/init.mk has been included before.
# - KINEO_PREFIX points to Kineo setup prefix.
# - KINEO_LIBDIR points to the library directory of the Kineo installation
#   prefix.
# - KINEO_ADDON_BUILDER points to the KineoAddonBuilder tool.
#
# Use Autoconf AC_SUBST to define these variables.
#
#
# Do not forget to add a dependency to the ``.kab'' file. One solution
# is adding the following in your ``Makefile.am'' file:
#
# kmoduledir= $(libdir)/modules/$(LICENCE_HOST)
#
# BUILT_SOURCES = my-kineo-plug-in.kab
# CLEANFILES = my-kineo-plug-in.kab
#
# kmodule_DATA = my-kineo-plug-in.kab
#

SUFFIXES += .kab

KINEO_LIB_SUFFIX ?= -$(PACKAGE_VERSION)

# Rules to generate Kineo license files from GNU Libtool libraries.
# It deduces automatically where are the real shared libraries from
# the Libtool file and call KineoAddonBuilder tool to sign it.

# Shared library rule.
